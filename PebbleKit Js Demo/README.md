# PebbleKit JS Demo app

## Simple Quote of the Day App

This app fetches a quote from https://theysaidso.com/api/ and displays it on the Pebble. Alternatively a user can set a custom quote. The user can also has the option to change the background color.

Some APIs used include:
- localstorage
- web requests
- configuration pages
- App messaging

This demo also makes use of the new [clay](https://github.com/pebble/clay) library to generate the configuration page locally.
